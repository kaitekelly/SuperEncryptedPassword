# Description:
When the user clicks the generate password button, a series of prompts will pop up and ask the user
how many characters they would like, and if they'd like to include lowercase, capitals, numbers and special characters. 

The generator will then return a password with the specified number of characters and character types. 

The site uses three main javascript functions and a for loop to generate the random password.
