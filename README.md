# SuperEncryptedPassword
A random password generator that lets the user choose character types and password length to include 
in the password when the generate password is clicked. 

When the user clicks the generate password button, a series of prompts will pop up and ask the user
how many characters they would like, and if they'd like to include lowercase, capitals, numbers and special characters. 

The generator will then return a password with the specified number of characters and character types. 

The site uses three main javascript functions and a for loop to generate the random password.
